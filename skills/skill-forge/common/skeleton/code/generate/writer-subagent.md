## IPC Contract (Snippet D)

### Direct Write + ACK model (guide §3.9)

The IPC model is **Direct Write + ACK**:

- The sub-agent writes to final paths **in its own sub-session** using the Write tool.
- The sub-agent's Task return is **exactly one line** (the ACK):
  - `OK trace_id=R3-W-007 role=<role> linked_issues=<comma-separated or empty>`
  - Writer-only extras: `self_review_status=<FULL_PASS|PARTIAL> fail_count=<N>`
  - On technical failure: `FAIL trace_id=R3-W-007 reason=<one-line>`

### Role → final-path mapping

| Role | Write count | Final paths |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `writer` | 2 writes | 1) `<artifact-path>`; 2) `.review/round-<N>/self-reviews/<trace_id>.md` |
| `reviewer` | N writes | One `.review/round-<N>/issues/<issue-id>.md` per issue found |
| `reviser` | 1 write | `<artifact-path>` (updated artifact leaf) |
| `planner` | 1 write | `.review/round-<N>/plan.md` |
| `summarizer` | N writes | One index file + `changelog` entry + `versions/<N>.md` |
| `judge` | 1 write | `.review/round-<N>/verdict.yml` |
| `domain_consultant` | 1 write | `.review/round-<N>/clarification.yml` |

### Blocker-scope taxonomy for writer self-review FAIL rows

| `blocker_scope` | Definition |
|-----------------|-----------|
| `global-conflict` | Leaf conflicts with another leaf or criterion — requires cross-artifact view outside writer scope |
| `cross-artifact-dep` | Leaf depends on a fact from another leaf not yet ready in this round |
| `needs-human-decision` | Choice requires information only a human can provide |
| `input-ambiguity` | Input spec is ambiguous or incomplete |

Every FAIL row MUST select exactly one `blocker_scope`.

### FORBIDDEN

- **FORBIDDEN** to write HTML-comment IPC envelopes into artifact leaves.
- **FORBIDDEN** to include generation content in the Task return — ACK is one line only.
- **FORBIDDEN** to emit multiple ACK lines or any content after the single ACK line.
- **FORBIDDEN** to "硬修" (force-fix in-place) a `global-conflict` self-review FAIL.

# writer-subagent — Writer Role for {{SKILL_NAME}}

<!-- DOMAIN_FILL: populated by writer-subagent during round 1 -->

**Role**: Writer (`W` in trace_id). Pure-write, no user interaction.

<!-- TODO: describe what "good output" looks like for this artifact domain -->
<!-- TODO: list applicable review criteria with PASS/FAIL examples -->
<!-- TODO: embed the 4 blocker_scope values and self-review discipline -->
<!-- TODO: include a positive example and a negative example -->
<!-- TODO: specify input contract (which files to read before writing) -->
<!-- TODO: specify output contract (artifact path + self-review path) -->

### ACK Format

```
OK trace_id=<trace_id> role=writer linked_issues=<comma-separated issue IDs or empty> self_review_status=<FULL_PASS|PARTIAL> fail_count=<N>
```

Return this ACK as the **single and final line** of the Task return. Nothing after it.
